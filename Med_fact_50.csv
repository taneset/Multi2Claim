11,The Earliest lesion seen in atherosclerosis is Fatty streaks.,"Ans: A (Fatty streaks) Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th edition.Explanation:Fatty streaks are the earliest lesions in atherosclerosis "" Ref: RobbinsMorphology of AtherosclerosisFatty StreaksThese are the earliest lesions in atherosclerosis.They are composed of lipid-filled foamy macrophages.Beginning as multiple minute flat yellow spots, they eventually coalesce into elongated streaks 1 cm or more in length.These lesions are not significantly raised and do not cause any flow disturbanceAortas of infants less than 1 year old can exhibit fatty streaks, and such lesions are seen in virtually all children older than 10 years, regardless of geography, race, sex, or environment.The relationship of fatty streaks to atherosclerotic plaques is uncertainThey may evolve into precursors of plaques, not all fatty streaks are destined to become advanced lesions.Atherosclerotic PlaqueThe key processes in atherosclerosis are intimal thickening and lipid accumulationAtheromatous plaques impinge on the lumen of the artery and grossly appear white to yellow: superimposed thrombus over ulcerated plaques is red-brown.Plaques vary from 0.3 to 1.5 cm in diameter but can coalesce to form larger massesAtherosclerotic lesions are patchy, on cross- section, the lesions appear ""eccentric""Local flow disturbances (e.g., turbulence at branch points) leads to increased susceptibility to plaque formation.In descending order, the most extensively involved vessels are theLower abdominal aorta (MC)The coronary arteries (Second MC)The popliteal arteriesThe internal carotid arteriesVessels of the circle of WillisVessels of the upper extremities are usually spared, as are the mesenteric and renal arteries, except at their ostia.Atherosclerotic plaques have three principal components:Cells, including smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and T cellsECM, including collagen, elastic fibers, and proteoglycansIntracellular and extracellular lipidSuperficial fibrous cap composed of smooth muscle cells and dense collagen.Beneath and to the side of the cap (the ""shoulder"") is a more cellular area containing macrophages, T cells, and smooth muscle cells.Deep to the fibrous cap is a necrotic core, containing lipid (primarily cholesterol and cholesterol esters), debris from dead cells, foam cells (lipid-laden macrophages and smooth muscle cells), fibrin, variably organized thrombus, and other plasma proteins and cholesterolThe periphery of the lesions show neovascularization (proliferating small blood vessels;Plaques generally continue to change and progressively enlarge due to cell death and degeneration, synthesis and degradation (remodeling) of ECM, and organization of thrombus.Atheromas often undergo calcificationAtherosclerotic plaques are susceptible to the following clinically important changes* Rupture, ulceration, or erosion of the intimal surface of atheromatous plaques exposes the blood to highly thrombogenic substances and induces thrombosis.* Such thrombosis can partially or completely occlude the lumen and lead to downstream ischemia.* If the patient survives the initial thrombotic occlusion, the clot may become organized and incorporated into the growing plaque.* Hemorrhage into a plaque. Rupture of the overlying fibrous cap, or of the thin-walled vessels in the areas of neovascularization, can cause intra-plaque hemorrhage; a contained hematoma may expand the plaque or induce plaque rupture.* Atheroembolism. Plaque rupture can discharge atherosclerotic debris into the bloodstream, producing microemboli* Alienism formation. Atherosclerosis-induced pressure or ischemic atrophy of the underlying media, with loss of elastic tissue, causes weakness resulting in aneurysmal dilation and potential rupture.",sup
12,Flipped LDH indicating Myocardial Infarction is represented by LDH-1> LDH -2.,"When LDH-1 is greater than LDH-2, it is referred to as flipped LDH and is indicative of MI. LDH-1 isoenzyme is found primarily in hea muscle and is lesser in concentration than the LDH-2 Isoenzyme which is primarily found in RBC. When the concentration of LDH-1 is observed to be greater than LDH2. It is referred to as flipped LDH and is indicative of Myocardial infarction. LDH has five isoenzymes: LDH-1 LDH-1 is found primarily in hea muscle 17% to 27% LDH-2 LDH-2 is primarily found in Red blood cells 27% to 37% LDH-3 LDH-3 is highest in the lung 18% to 25% LDH-4 LDH-4 is highest in the kidney, placenta, and pancreas 3% to 8% LDH-5 LDH-5 is highest in the liver and skeletal muscle 0% to 5% The LDH test helps determine the location of tissue damage.

When your LDH-5 is greater than your LDH-4: It could mean damage to the liver or liver disease. This includes cirrhosis and hepatitis. Ref: Harrisons 19th edition",sup
13,Receptor activation is not a component of transpo system.,"Functions: Transpo Systems An essential role of biomembranes is to allow movement of all compounds necessary for the normal function of a cell across the membrane barrier. These compounds include a vast array of substances like sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, steroids, cations and anions to mention a few. These compounds must enter or leave the cells in an orderly manner for normal functioning of the cell. A. 1. Ion Channels Ion channels are transmembrane channels, pore-like structures composed of proteins. Specific channels for Na+, K+, Ca++, and Cl- have been identified. Cation conductive channels are negatively charged within the channel and have an average diameter of about 5 to 8 nm. All ion channels are basically made up of transmembrane subunits that come together to form a central pore through which ions pass selectively. All channels have gates and are controlled by opening and closing. Types of Gates Two types of gated channels. They are a. Ligand-gated channels: In this, a specific molecule binds to a receptor and opens the channel. Example: Acetylcholine receptor is present in the postsynaptic membrane. It is a complex of five subunits, having a binding site for acetylcholine. Acetylcholine released from the presynaptic region binds with the binding site of the postsynaptic region, which triggers the opening of the channel and influx of Na+. b. Voltage-gated channels: These channels open or close in response to changes in membrane potential. Some propeies of ion channels * Composed of transmembrane protein subunits. * Highly selective. * Well regulated by the presence of ""gates"". * Two main types of gates: Ligand-gated and voltage-gated. * Activities are affected by ceain drugs. * Mutations of genes encoding transmembrane proteins can cause specific diseases. 2. Ionophores Ceain microorganisms can synthesize small organic molecules, called ionophores, which function as shuttles for the movement of ions across the membrane. Structure: These ionophores contain hydrophilic centres that bind specific ions and are surrounded by peripheral hydrophobic regions. Types: Two types: (a) Mobile ion carriers: Like valinomycin (Refer uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation). (b) Channel formers: Like gramicidin. 3. Water Channels (Aquaporins) In ceain cells, e.g. in red blood cells, and cells of the collecting ductules of the kidney, the movement of water by simple diffusion is enhanced by movements of water through water channels, composed of tetrameric transmembrane proteins called aquaporins. About five distinct types of aquaporins have been recognised. CLINICAL ASPECT Recently mutations in the gene encoding AP-2 (Aquaporin 2) protein, have been shown to be the cause of one type of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. 4. Gap Junction Ceain cells develop specialized regions on their membranes for intercellular communications which are in close proximity. Function: They mediate and regulate the passage of ions and small molecules upto 1000 to 2000 mol wt, through a narrow hydrophilic core connecting the cytosol of adjacent cells. Structure: They are primarily composed of protein, called connexon which contains four membrane-spanning a-helices. the mitochondrial membrane also has paicularly energy coupling mechanism.Ref: MN Chatterjea Textbook of Medical Biochemistry, 8th edition",sup

Loss of schooling and social contact, as well as frequent hospitalisation, can have impoant psychosocial consequences.Treatment is similar to that described for adults and may require glucocoicoids, immunosuppressive drugs, biological agents and surgery. Monitoring of height, weight and sexual development is crucial. Children with IBD should be managed by specialised paediatric gastroenterologists and transitioned to adult care in dedicated clinics . Pregnancy A women's ability to become pregnant is adversely affected by active IBD. Pre-conceptual counselling should focus on optimising disease control. During pregnancy, the rule of thirds applies: roughly one-third of women improve, one-third get worse and one-third remain stable with active disease. In the post-paum period, these changes sometimes reverse spontaneously. Drug therapy, including aminosalicylates, glucocoicoids Delayed growth and pubeal development: chronic active inflammation, malabsorption, malnutrition and long-term glucocoicoids contribute to sho stature and delayed development, with physical and psychological consequences. * Metabolic bone disease: more common with chronic disease beginning in childhood, resulting from chronic inflammation, dietary deficiency and malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D. * Drug side-effects and adherence issues: young people are more likely to require azathioprine or biological therapy than adults. Poor adherence to therapy is more common than with adults, as younger patients may feel well, lack self-motivation to adhere and believe that drugs are ineffective or cause side-effects. * Loss of time from education: physical illness, surgery, fatigue in chronic inflammatory bowel disease, privacy and dignity issues, and social isolation may all contribute. * Emotional difficulties: may result from challenges in coping with illness, problems with forming interpersonal relationships, and issues relating to body image or sexual function.

Each episode, called an apnea, lasts long enough so that one or more breaths are missed, and such episodes occur repeatedly throughout sleep.> The standard definition of any apneic event includes a minimum 10 second interval between breaths, with either a neurological arousal (a 3-second or greater shift in EEG frequency, measured at C3, C4, O1, or O2), a blood oxygen desaturation of 3-4deg/: or greater, or both arousal and desaturation. Sleep apnea is diagnosed with an overnight sleep test called a polysomnogram, or a ""Sleep Study"".> Treatment: The most common treatment and arguably the most consistently effective treatment for sleep apnea is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device, which 'splints' the patient's airway open during sleep by means of a flow of pressurized air into the throat. However the CPAP machine only assists inhaling whereas a BiPAP machine assists with both inhaling and exhaling, and is used in more severe cases.

38,A victim of Tsunami has difficulty in overcoming the experience because she still recollects the happening in dreams and thoughts. The most likely diagnosis is Post traumatic stress disorder.,"PTSD is characterised by recurrent and intrusive recollections of the stressful event, either in flashbacks (images, thoughts, or perceptions) and/or in dreams. There is an associated sense of re-experiencing of the stressful event. There is marked avoidance of the events or situations that arouse recollections of the stressful event, along with marked symptoms of anxiety and increased arousal. The other impoant clinical features of PTSD include paial amnesia for some aspects of the stressful event, feeling of numbness, and anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure).

39,More than 90 % patients of CREST syndrome with the limited cutaneous form of this disorder make Anti-centromere.,"All forms of scleroderma are thought to have a strong autoimmune component, and glucocoicoids and azathioprine are used to suppress the inflammatory complications of scleroderma. (Other drugs that can be used in therapy include penicillamine, which inhibits collagen cross-linking, NSAIDS for pain, and ACE inhibitors to protect the kidney if hypeension or renal damage occurs). The anti-centromere antibody is quite specific for CREST syndrome (96% of cases), and is only seen in a minority of patients with diffuse scleroderma (mainly those with Raynaud's phenomenon) and rarely in systemic lupus erythematosus and mixed connective tissue disease.Also know:Anti-DNA topoisomerase I , also called anti-Scl-70 occurs commonly (64-75%) in diffuse scleroderma, but only rarely in CREST syndrome.Anti-double-stranded DNA is fairly specific for systemic lupus erythematosus, although it only occurs in 50-60% of lupus cases.Anti-Golgi antibodies are seen most often in systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogren syndrome.

AS is a form of spondyloarthritis, a chronic, inflammatory arthritis where immune mechanisms are thought to have a key role. It mainly affects joints in the spine and the sacroiliac joint in the pelvis, and can cause eventual fusion of the spine.> The typical patient is a young male, aged 20-40; however, the condition also presents in females.> The condition is known to be hereditary. Symptoms of the disease first appear, on average, at age 23 years. These first symptoms are typically chronic pain and stiffness in the middle part of the spine or sometimes the entire spine, often with pain referred to one or other buttock or the back of thigh from the sacroiliac joint.",sup

45,"In a family, the father has widely spaced eyes, increased facial hair and deafness is normal in this case.","A i.e. Autosomal dominant (most likely) Waardenburg's Syndrome (WS) is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by pigmentary disturbances (skin, hair, iris), sensorineural hearing loss, and other developmental anomalies such as dystopia canthorum (widely spaced eyes) and blepharophimosis. The syndrome that closest matches the features provided in the question is Waardeburg syndrome type-I. This is inherited as an autosomal dominant fashion and hence is the answer of exclusion. As the question does not provide us with details as to the sex of the three children, a sex linked inheritance pattern cannot be worked out. Also the combined presentation of an affected father, unaffected mother and one affected child among three children is possible with both an autosomal dominant and an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. In absence of any more details, the answer to this question cannot be deduced through the exploration of various permutations and combinations. How both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance can be responsible for the above combination: Autosomal Dominant Autosomal recessive (A-affected allele and a normal allele) If the disease is transmitted in an Autosomal Dominant then :Father (affected) will be either 'AA' or 'Aa' Mother (unaffected) will be 'aa' If father is AA and mother aa, the offsprings will be 1. aA - 100% affected If father is Aa and mother aa, the offsprings will Aa - 50% affected aa - 50% not affected The scenario in the above question therefore is possible autosomal dominant inheritance if father is Aa and mother is aa (A'-affected allele and 'a' normal allele) If the disease is transmitted in an Autosomal recessive form :Father (affected) will be 'AA' Mother (unaffected) may be 'aa' or 'Aa' If father is AA and mother aa, the offsprings will be 1. aA - 100% not affected, (but carriers) If father is AA and mother Aa, the offsprings will be Aa - 50% not affected, carrier AA - 50% affected The scenario in the above question therefore is possible with autosomal recessive inheritance if father is aa and mother is Aa",sup
